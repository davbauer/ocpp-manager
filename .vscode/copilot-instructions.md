# Project Coding Guidelines

You are working in a large, growing codebase. Follow these rules at all times:

## Structure & Design

- Split code by clear concerns; keep functions, classes, and modules focused and composable.
- Match the existing project structure and naming conventions.

## Naming

- Use clear, self-explanatory names for functions, classes, and variables.
- Names can be slightly longer if needed to convey meaning, but avoid verbosity.

## Code Quality

- Never leave dead code, unused functions, or unused imports.
- Only add comments for non-obvious logic.
- Avoid redundant checks, trial-and-error scaffolding, or placeholders.

## Implementation Style

- Write concise, efficient, and robust solutions.
- Prefer single, clean implementations over multiple alternatives.
- Follow the style and patterns of the existing codebase exactly.

## Safety & Reliability

- Code should be safe, predictable, and easy to understand.
